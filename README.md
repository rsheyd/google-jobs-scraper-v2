# Google Jobs Scraper v2

### About the project

This is a fork of the original [Google Jobs Scraper](https://github.com/alimahmoud7/google-jobs-scraper) project. I plan to maintain and update it as needed to ensure continued functionality and address any potential issues with outdated dependencies.

> Simply, The script scrapes all the jobs from all the pages (first to final available page) located on [https://careers.google.com/jobs](https://careers.google.com/jobs#t=sq&li=20&st=0&jlo=all) and return's the result as a JSON string, Then you will have a JSON file containing  all scraped data.

### How to Run the Program

1. Download and Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
2. Install requirements
```
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 selenium
```
3. Download the latest release of [Chrome Driver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) for your OS
4. Extract chromedriver and move it to the same directory of `scrape_google.py` file
5. Finally, Run `scrape_google.py`
```
python scrape_google.py
```
